Code for a browser called Coin Catcher.

# Purpose

Created as my first Project with Sparta Global using Javascript, HTML and CSS.

# Functionality

This is a simple game that was designed mainly with Javascript. 
When the game is started, two images, a coin and bird, are randomly genereted in a 40 by 19 grid.
The bird will move to the position of the coin and the player has to move the mouse over the coin to score ten points.
Once the user scores the points, the coin and bird are generated randomly again and the process keeps repeating.
